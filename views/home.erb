  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I grew up in Davis county and right out of college I joined a rock band and<br>
   toured the country for 2 years as a musician. When I grew tired of living out<br>
   of a 15 passenger van, and eating off Taco Bells $1 menu, I moved to Denver, CO.<br>
   There I met my wife Peri, and in 2012 she gave birth to my son and best bud Nolan.<br>
   After 10 years in Colorado we moved back to Utah. Even though I grew up in Utah<br>
   I still claim to be from Colorado, that's how much we loved it.
   <br>
   <br>
   Since leaving ColoRADo I've been in investment banking, and I've hated it<br>
   since the day I started. This winter I decided I'd had enough and started to learn<br>
   HTML/CSS through Codecademy. Shortly after I knew that was the direction I <br>
   wanted to take. I called up DevPoint to get some info and subsequently I applied.<br>
   After an interview with Will I was sold, and was accepted into DevPoint a few days <br>
   later. The day after I was accepted I resigned from my job of 10 years. I sent my<br>
   manager my resignation letter in HTML... fitting end to a new start.
